    </div>
    <p>I am a huge fan of soccer! I played for over 10 years, always playing a defensive position, but I primarily play centerback. I enjoy the sport and the creativity behind every unique play. While our team even made it to state league in Arizona, I could never imagine being one of the best players in the world. Here is a fun site to show you some of my personal favorite and best soccer players out there!</p>

<h2>2018 World Cup Finals</h2>
<p>This is a Tableau graph of statistics from the 2018 World Cup Finals. There are notable stats to look at to determine how France was able to seal the win and mark the 2nd time they won the World Cup. I found these stats to be very interesting! What interesting facts can you notice about the players during different times and plays of the game?</p>
